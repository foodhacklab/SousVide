TIC (Thermal Inmersion Circulator) / Sous Vide Machine for Low temperature Cooking

This is version V1.0: the first version of 3D printed version of the TIC we worked on.
We did several prototypes before getting to this 3D printed design, all of them made by a laser-cutting machine. 

This version was intended to be the first 3D printed one, once the functional aspects were tested in the previous prototypes.
