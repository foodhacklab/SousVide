TIC (Thermal Inmersion Circulator) / Sous Vide Machine for Low temperature Cooking

This is version V1.0: the first version of 3D printed version of the TIC we worked on.
We did several prototypes before getting to this 3D printed design, all of them made by a laser-cutting machine. 

This version was intended to be the first 3D printed one, once the functional aspects were tested in the previous prototypes. 

This version includes:

- 1 PID Controller.
- 1 Solid State Relay.
- 1 Power Switch.
- 1 Power Supply Plug. 
- 1 ON/OFF Indicator LED.
- 1 Mixer Motor.
- (+1 AC-DC converter to convert the AC power to DC for the Mixer Motor).
- 2 Water Heater Resistors (the ones usually used to make tea on a Camping). 
- 1 Axis (for the mixer).
- Common IKEA Cutterly pot. 
- 3D Printed Parts:
  - UI_Shell_V1.0
  - Main_Shell_V1.0
  - Mixer Helix_V1.0
